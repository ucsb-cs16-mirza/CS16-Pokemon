# CS16 Pokemon Challenge
## Gotta Catch 'Em All!
Author: Jared Flores  

### How to Play
- Inside the /gyms folder, you'll find folders A, B, C, and D
- The letter corresponds to the tier. A is the highest (hard), D is the lowest (easy)
- Inside each tier, you'll find four folders, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each correspond with a Pokemon
- Inside any of those numbered folders (for instance /D/1) there is a `main.cpp`
- All of the challenge & code will be in `main.cpp`; modify that file to solve the challenge
- Once you're ready, run `make`, and that will compile & run the Pokemon catch

### Output
You will get output that looks like:  
```
Wild PIKACHU appeared!

> Catch
Your code is: Pikachu-048B
```  


This code will be used to figure out if you actually solved the problem correctly.  
There may also be a line in the code `POKEMON`, this is used by the internal grading algorithm,
so don't remove that!  


Have fun!
